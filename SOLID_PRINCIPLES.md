# SOLID Principles Guide

This document provides guidance on implementing SOLID principles in the Postman MCP Server. These principles help create maintainable, flexible, and robust code.

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

The following critical implementation guidelines are directly tied to SOLID principles and must be strictly followed:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each module, class, or function should have one and only one reason to change.

- **Main Worker Class**: Handles MCP protocol interactions only, delegates business logic to Services
- **Services**: Contain business logic related to a specific domain
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts for interacting with services and data structures

Implementation examples:
- The main `MyWorker` class should only handle the MCP interface
- `PostmanService` should contain business logic for interacting with Postman API
- `NewmanService` should handle test execution logic

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- Use inheritance or composition to extend functionality
- Create base classes or interfaces that can be extended without modification
- Use dependency injection to allow for different implementations

Implementation examples:
- Create a base `ApiService` class that specific services can extend
- Use interfaces to define contracts for different types of operations
- Use dependency injection to swap implementations as needed

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

- Derived classes must maintain the behavior expected of their base classes
- Override methods should adhere to the same contract as base methods
- Always use proper inheritance hierarchies

Implementation examples:
- If we create a `MockServerService` and `TestExecutionService`, both should implement the same base interface if they're used interchangeably
- Service implementation should conform to their interface contracts
- Error handling should be consistent across all services

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

- Create specific, focused interfaces rather than general-purpose ones
- Split large interfaces into more specific ones
- Use composition to combine functionality

Implementation examples:
- Create separate interfaces for collection management and test execution
- Define focused method signatures that do one thing well
- Split large operations into smaller, focused ones

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

- Depend on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations
- Use dependency injection for flexible component composition
- Configure dependencies externally rather than instantiating them internally

Implementation examples:
- Services should accept their dependencies rather than creating them internally
- The main worker class should receive service implementations via dependency injection
- Use factory methods to create service instances when needed

## Practical Application in the MCP Server

### 150-Line Limit and Single Responsibility Principle

The strict 150-line limit per file directly supports the Single Responsibility Principle by:
- Forcing modules to focus on a single responsibility
- Preventing the accumulation of unrelated functionality
- Making code more modular and maintainable
- Encouraging proper separation of concerns

When a file approaches the 150-line limit, it's a strong indicator that it's handling multiple responsibilities and should be split into separate components.

### Code Reuse and SOLID Principles

Avoiding code duplication is fundamental to several SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: Reusing code ensures functionality exists in only one place
- **Open/Closed**: Properly reusing code means extending behavior without modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Reusable components must maintain consistent behavior
- **Interface Segregation**: Well-designed reusable interfaces focus on specific needs
- **Dependency Inversion**: Reusable components depend on abstractions, not details

### SOLID in Cloudflare Workers Context

In the context of Cloudflare Workers and the MCP protocol:

1. **Single Responsibility**:
   - The main Worker class should only handle the MCP protocol interaction
   - Each service should focus on a specific domain (Postman, Newman, etc.)
   - Utility functions should do one thing and do it well

2. **Open/Closed**:
   - Use TypeScript interfaces to define contracts
   - Implement services that can be extended without modifying base code
   - Use composition to combine functionality

3. **Liskov Substitution**:
   - Service implementations should be interchangeable if they implement the same interface
   - Mock implementations should behave like real ones for testing
   - Error handling should be consistent

4. **Interface Segregation**:
   - Define focused interfaces for each capability
   - Group related methods into specific interfaces
   - Don't force a service to implement methods it doesn't need

5. **Dependency Inversion**:
   - Services should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
   - Pass dependencies to constructors or methods
   - Use a simple dependency injection pattern

### Implementation Strategy for Code Reuse

When implementing new features or modifying existing code, follow this strategy to ensure proper code reuse:

1. **Identify Similar Functionality**: Before implementing new code, search for similar functionality in the codebase
2. **Extract Common Patterns**: If you find similar code in multiple places, extract it into a shared utility or service
3. **Use Composition**: Favor composition over inheritance for reusing functionality
4. **Create Utilities**: Create small, focused utility functions for common operations
5. **Design for Reuse**: When writing new code, consider how it might be reused in the future
